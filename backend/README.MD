React Props & State Lifting Practice

This project contains small React practice examples to understand props, state lifting, and component-based thinking.

What I Learned

How to pass data and functions using props

Why state should live in the parent when multiple components need it

How children communicate with parent using callback functions

Difference between local state and shared (lifted) state

How to handle controlled inputs correctly

When to update parent state:

during typing (live update)

on button click (submit-based update)

Concepts Practiced

Props

State lifting

List rendering

Controlled inputs

Component responsibility separation

Practice Examples

Shared Counter (state lifting)

Color Picker & Display

Input Box with Text Preview

Key Takeaway

Parent owns the state.
Children receive data and trigger updates via props.
